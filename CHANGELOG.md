# Changelog

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## v0.8.5

* Improvements
  * `RingLogger.grep/2` supports `:before` and `:after` options
  * Support OTP 25

## v0.8.4

* Fixes
  * Default color enabled option now correctly evaluated at runtime for the active IO

* Improvements
  * `RingLogger.grep` will now highlight matches in the output if color is enabled

## v0.8.3

* Fixes
  * Pull all application environment configuration from `:logger, RingLogger`
    rather than some from there and some from `:ring_logger`. Adding
    configuration under `:ring_logger` is still supported, but prints a
    deprecation warning. Thanks to Jason Axelson for this fix.

## v0.8.2

* Improvements
  * Circular buffer improvements are all upstream in the `circular_buffer`
    library, so this release makes it official by deleting the internal
    implementation and using the hex package.

## v0.8.1

* New features
  * `RingLogger.next/1` now outputs a summary line that says how many log
    messages were recented and how many were filtered. This makes it easier to
    identify when the ring buffer is being overtaken by filtered log entries

* Improvements
  * Several internal refactorings were made to reduce memory usage and
    the number of reductions run in the `RingLogger.Server` GenServer. This
    makes a noticeable improvement when monitoring resource usage on a device.
  * Improved tests to verify more edge conditions

## v0.8.0

* New features
  * Support filtering by OTP application. This uses the same mechanism as
    per-module filtering by automatically adding in all modules that are part of
    an OTP application. It is super useful! See the README.md. Thanks to Jon
    Carstons for adding this feature.
  * Support setting defaults on RingLogger clients so that you can configure
    things like a global default to info level messages and then only show
    debug messages from some applications

## v0.7.0

* New features
  * Added `save/1` to save the current set of log messages in the ring buffer to
    a file

## v0.6.1

* Bug fixes
  * Make `RingLogger.grep` friendlier by supporting strings as arguments

## v0.6.0

Important: `RingLogger.tail` is now `RingLogger.next`. `RingLogger.tail` shows
the last n lines of the log (default is 10).

* New features
  * `grep` greps the whole log entry rather than just the message portion. You
    can `grep` on timestamps and message levels now.
  * Functions that print log messages do the printing in the caller's context so
    that printing timeouts don't happen in RingLogger GenServers calls.
  * Added `:none` as a per-module log level to completely silence a module.
  * Added `:pager` option to specify a custom printer for the interactive
    commands.

## v0.5.0

* New features
  * Add support for changing the log levels on a per-module basis. Thanks to
    Matt Ludwigs for this change. See the README.md for details.
  * Add a `:format` option to accept a custom format function similar to how
    `Logger` supports custom formatting. Thanks to Tim Mecklem for this.
  * Bumped default ring buffer size from 100 messages to 1024.

* Bug fixes
  * Log clients are now fully configurable. Previous versions inadvertantly
    limited the options that could be set.

## v0.4.1

* Bug fixes
  * Fix crash when `grep`'ing iodata
  * Fix `init/1` callback return value when only specifying the module.

## v0.4.0

* New features
  * Added `grep`
  * Automatically add the backend if it's not running when using the IEx helpers

## v0.3.0

Renamed `LoggerCircularBuffer` to `RingLogger` and made backwards incompatible
API changes. Please review docs when upgrading.

* New features
  * Simplified use from IEx by autostarting the Client GenServer
  * Added support for `tail`ing logs

## v0.2.0

Renamed `LoggerCircularBuffer` to `LoggerCircularBuffer`

## v0.1.0

Initial release
